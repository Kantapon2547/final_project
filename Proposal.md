## Evaluation Step

### Submission of the Report by a Student:

Students are required to submit their project reports for evaluation. This step involves the submission of detailed documentation covering various aspects of the project.

### Evaluation by Faculty Members:

- Faculty members will carefully review and assess the submitted project reports.
- Feedback will be provided to students, offering constructive comments on strengths and areas for improvement.
- A numerical score will be assigned based on predefined evaluation criteria.

### Aggregation of Scores:

The system will collect and aggregate scores from all faculty members who evaluated the reports.

### Determination of Overall Project Score:

The overall project score will be calculated based on the aggregated scores. This score reflects the combined evaluation from all faculty members.

### Feedback to Students:

Students will receive detailed feedback from faculty members. This feedback aims to guide students in understanding the assessment and areas where they excelled or need improvement.

### Conditional Approval or Revision Request:

- If the project meets the predefined criteria and obtains a satisfactory overall score, it will proceed to final approval.
- In case revisions are necessary, students will be informed of the specific areas that require attention. They are expected to make the necessary changes before resubmitting the project for evaluation.
