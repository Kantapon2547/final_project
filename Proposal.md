# Project Evaluation Proposal

## Overview

The process outlined for project submission involves an evaluation step to ensure the submitted report meets 
the necessary criteria. So this evaluation step is crucial and occurs between the submission and final approval steps.

## Evaluation Process

The evaluation process consists of several key actions that need to be performed by a group of faculties. 
Below is an outline of these actions along with the corresponding code snippets:

### Review or Check Submission

In my opinion, before starting the formal evaluation, the submitted project report needs to be reviewed to ensure
that it meets the basic requirements. And then, at random or by choosing some of the faculty members to evaluate
the projects, provide scores and feedback. Next, we can create a function to calculate an overall score.
from individual evaluations. The last one is to make a decision based on overall scores and return it approved or rejected.

```python
# This is an example of Python code that I think it is necessary to review the submission and evaluation. 
def checks_submission(submission):
    # Check if the submission follows guidelines
    # Return True if it's ready for evaluation, False otherwise
    pass

def pick_evaluators(submission, faculties):
    # Randomly or strategically choose faculty members to evaluate
    pass

def evaluate_project(submission, evaluator):
    # Assess different parts of the submission
    # Provide scores or feedback
    pass

def combine_scores(evaluations):
    # Calculate an overall score from individual evaluations
    pass

def approve_or_reject(final_score):
    # Make a decision based on the overall score
    # Return True if approved, False if rejected
    pass
